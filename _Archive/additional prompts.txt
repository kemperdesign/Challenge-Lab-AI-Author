Convert this into a Challenge Lab


Scan this document and provide me with Official Microsoft Advanced Hint links in Challenge Lab format. Match them to the associated Task.

Every :::ShowAdvanced section needs to follow this wording: 

:::ShowAdvanced(ShowAdvanced=Yes) 
>[!knowledge] Want to learn more? Review the documentation on [REPLACE1]( https://git-scm.com/docs "REPLACE2"). ::: 

Where it says "REPLACE1", replace the text with a reference to the Task it relates to. 
Where it says "REPLACE2", replace the text with the Name of the document or article it links to.. 
You will replace the sample link I supplied with the actual link you discovered.
Check for broken links and replace them before delivery.

rewrite in this format: 

:::ShowAdvanced(ShowAdvanced=Yes) 
>[!knowledge] Want to learn more? Review the documentation on [creating Task #](https://docs.microsoft.com/ "Create Task # Guidance"). 
:::




Each Guided hint header now reads:
>[+hint] Expand this hint for guidance on [task reference]

Sentence case task references (Option A).

All prior formatting, advanced sections, and wording preserved.




replace all instances of ">1." with ">-". Repeat with any other similiar numbers as well. Replace the word "Click" and "Press" with the word "Select".


Where ever you see "Expand this hint for guidance on..." , replace "..." with a reference to the Task it relates to. Like we did for the Advanced Hints.


Anywhere we see ">-Run:", replace it with ">-Run the following command:"




The overview will begin with:

You are a @lab.Variable(GlobalDeveloper) at @lab.Variable(GlobalCompany)


whenever 2 lines are one after the other like this: >- Create a folder named copilot_docs/. >- Open it in **VS Code**. Can you add a space like this: >- Create a folder named copilot_docs/. > >- Open it in **VS Code**.


when you see this:

:::
:::ShowAdvanced(ShowAdvanced=Yes)

Change to this:

:::


:::ShowAdvanced(ShowAdvanced=Yes)




Remove all references to a "Requirement #" and "Task #"
